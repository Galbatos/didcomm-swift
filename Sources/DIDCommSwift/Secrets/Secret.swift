/**
 A secret (private key) abstraction.
 
 - Parameters:
   - kid: The key ID identifying a secret (private key).
         Must have the same value as the key ID (`id` field)
         of the corresponding method in DID Doc containing a public key.
   - type: The secret (private key) type.
           Must have the same value as type (`type` field) of
           the corresponding method in DID Doc containing a public key.
   - verificationMaterial: The value of the secret (private key) as a string.
                           The value is type-specific and has the same format
                           as the corresponding public key value from the DID Doc.
                           For example, for 'JsonWebKey2020' type, it will be a JWK JSON string.
                           For 'X25519KeyAgreementKey2019' type, it will be a base58-encoded string.
